> The Unicorn's Horn is a weekly summary of what we have been up to lately at Mendicant University. It should come in handy for folks who want to keep up with what we are working on, but don't have time to read each and every one of our updates.

Wow what an amazing week it has been here at Mendicant University! If you haven't had an opportunity to get involved yet, don't worry. Each week we have a bunch of different activities and this is the place to see what happened, and what's coming up next at Mendicant.

#### What happened this week: ####

* Shane Emmons ran an [open source software clinic](/activities/2012/06/11/oss-clinic-anita.html) this past Monday which focused on Anita, Mendicant's new IRC bot. A bunch of [new ideas](https://github.com/mendicant/anita/issues?state=open) were generated and everyone is encouraged to get hackin'.

* That same day Eric Gjertsen held office hours where he reviewed an implementation of the [turtle tracks puzzle](http://puzzlenode.com/puzzles/9-turtle-tracks) and reviewed a data conversion project.

* On Thursday Mendicant hosted its 5th [Global Hack Day](/activities/2012/06/14/global-hack-day-5.html). Participants worked on a wide range of projects throughout the day. To see a full transcript and a list of projects hacked on, check out the event's [wiki page](https://github.com/mendicant/mendicantuniversity.org/wiki/Global-Hack-Day-5)

#### Upcoming Plans:

* Sean Marcia will host a "[Share Your Favourite Gem](/activities/2012/06/19/share-your-favourite-gem.html)" discussion next Tuesday. Come swap gems &mdash; from the must-haves to the most unknown.

* After that, Pablo Torres and Gary Bernhardt will be hosting a group study session on [Persistence Objects vs Domain Logic](/activities/2012/06/19/persistence-objects.html).

* Mendicant is putting together its first "Meet-n-Greet" on Thursday right before the [Mendicant Birthday Gathering](/activities/2012/06/21/mendicant-birthday-gathering.html). Stop by to meet new people and have some fun before the party "officially" starts.

* Lastly, Mendicant turned the big 2.0 (years) a few weeks ago and we want to mark the occasion with an informal gathering. As always everyone is invited to come hang out, post their favorite cat pictures, and just goof around.

That's all the news for this week. Stay tuned for another issue of the Unicorn's Horn next week and have fun. Go Unicorns!
