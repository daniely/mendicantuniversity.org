We'd like to gauge interest in future OSS Clinics. If you have time, please
[answer these survey questions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?fromEmail=true&formkey=dGpHems3WXNOWlZtYXFpMXVvWHB5OHc6MQ)
to help us improve our execution.

OSS Clinics are meant to be a period of time (similar to a hackday) where the
community focuses their energy on a single OSS project. This is both to give
back to the project, but also give those new to OSS an safe and helpful
environment for getting their feet wet with OSS contribution.
