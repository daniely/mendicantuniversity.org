We'd like to gauge interest in future OSS Clinics. If you have time, please
[answer these survey questions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?fromEmail=true&formkey=dGpHems3WXNOWlZtYXFpMXVvWHB5OHc6MQ)
to help us improve our execution.

OSS Clinics are meant to be a period of time (similar to a hackday) where the
community focuses their energy on a single OSS project. This serves two
purposes. To give back to the project and also give those new to OSS a safe and
helpful environment for getting their feet wet with OSS contribution.
