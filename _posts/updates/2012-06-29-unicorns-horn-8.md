> The Unicorn's Horn is a weekly summary of what we have been up to lately at Mendicant University. It should come in handy for folks who want to keep up with what we are working on, but don't have time to read each and every one of our updates.

#### What happened this week:

* Eric Gjersten ran office hours this past Thursday where he answered a [question about safe buffers in Rails 3](http://anita.mendicantuniversity.org/mendicant/2012-06-28..2012-06-29.html)

* Shane Emmons [asked our community members](http://mendicantuniversity.org/updates/2012/06/26/oss-clinic-survey.html) to give some feedback on open source software clinics. Shane ran the first open clinic two weeks ago on [Anita](https://github.com/mendicant/anita), Mendicant's new IRC bot.

* The Mendicant Homesteaders setup a time to meet next week where they will discuss the future plans for Mendicant now that Gregory has stepped out of his coordinator role.

#### Upcoming Plans:

As of right now we don't have any scheduled activities for the coming week, but be sure to check this site, twitter, or our RSS feed for new activities posted during the week.
