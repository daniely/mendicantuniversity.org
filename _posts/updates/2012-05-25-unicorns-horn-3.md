> The Unicorn's Horn is a weekly summary of what we have been up to lately at Mendicant University. It should come in handy for folks who want to keep up with what we are working on, but don't have time to read each and every one of our updates.

Howdy everybody! Here's your weekly dose of Mendicant news.

#### What happened this week:

* Jordan Byron and Shane Emmons held office hours this week. Discussions ranged from Rails to Marching Band.

* We held a Town Hall meeting [on Wednesday](https://gist.github.com/2787815). We discussed why people are involved with Mendicant, and began discussing our community Guidelines. Specifically we focused on how to maintain Mendicant as a safe community and to define our relationship with Open Source. You can read all about it in [this meeting summary](https://github.com/mendicant/mendicantuniversity.org/wiki/Town-Hall-Meeting-%282012-05-24%29).

#### Upcoming Plans:

* Greg will soon be running his [Technical Writing Clinic](http://mendicantuniversity.org/updates/2012/05/16/preliminary-task-for-tech-writing.html).

* We will almost certainly offer some free-form office hours, but they have not yet been scheduled. Keep an eye on this website, or follow [@mendicant_news](http://twitter.com/mendicant_news) if you are interested in participating.

* The Mendicant homesteaders will continue to work on whatever needs to be done to make the new Mendicant University a wonderful place to be. In particular, we will continue working on documentation explaining how to get involved, and how our school works.

That's all the news for this week. Stay tuned for another issue of the Unicorn's Horn next week and have fun! Go Unicorns!
