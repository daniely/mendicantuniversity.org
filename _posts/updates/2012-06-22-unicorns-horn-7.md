> The Unicorn's Horn is a weekly summary of what we have been up to lately at Mendicant University. It should come in handy for folks who want to keep up with what we are working on, but don't have time to read each and every one of our updates.

#### What happened this week:

* Eric Gjersten ran office hours, which lead to an [interesting discussion about testing](http://anita.mendicantuniversity.org/mendicant/2012-06-18..2012-06-18%2018:59%20UTC).

* Sean Marcia ran a session called [Share your favourite gem](http://mendicantuniversity.org/activities/2012/06/19/share-your-favourite-gem.html), inviting everyone to recommend the gems that they have found especially useful or interesting. Afterwards, Sean compiled the [list of gems](https://github.com/mendicant/mendicantuniversity.org/wiki/Share-your-favourite-gem-%282012-06-19%29) that participants had suggested.

* Gary Bernhardt joined us for a session on [persistence objects vs. domain objects](http://mendicantuniversity.org/activities/2012/06/19/persistence-objects.html). The original plan was to discuss the topic for an hour or so, but Gary stayed around long after that to answer questions on a wide range of topics. We still need to put together a detailed summary, but you can check out the [meeting notes and transcript](http://practicingruby.com:9001/p/study-session-june-19) for now.

* We celebrated Mendicant University's two year birthday with a social gathering, which mostly resulted in conversations about video games, but was fun nonetheless!

* Gregory Brown announced that [he needs to take a break](http://forum.mendicantuniversity.org/discussion/32/changing-my-role-in-mendicant#Body) from administrative responsibilities at Mendicant. He will still be around helping out with various things as needed, but now more than ever Mendicant will need the help of the whole community to keep thriving.

#### Upcoming Plans:

* Eric Gjertsen is [hosting office hours](http://mendicantuniversity.org/activities/2012/06/28/office-hours-with-eric_gjertsen.html) on Thursday, June 28. If you have Ruby questions or want a code review, be sure to stop by.

We don't have any other scheduled events for next week just yet, as we're catching up from a very busy couple of weeks. But you can expect to see more soon, including our first weekend hack day.
