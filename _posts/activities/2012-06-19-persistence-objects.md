We were discussing the difference between an object that persists to database and an object that implements business behavior in our IRC channel, and the conversation was so interesting that we decided to turn it into a full-blown group study session. We were reminded of a screencast that Gary Bernhardt recorded for his Destroy All Software series and we decided to invite him to discuss the topic with us.

Please join us on June 19 from 20:00 - 21:00 UTC for a group discussion on how to best keep database wrapping and domain logic separated in different objects.
